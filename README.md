### 1. Who is Sam Bent?


First of all, some context. Sam Bent is a Darknet drug trafficker who was arrested in 2019 for selling illegal drugs online.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

This is a quote from the Vermont Department of justice

> The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont stated that Sam Bent, 33,
> of Saint Johnsbury, Vermont was sentenced today to a five-year period of incarceration upon
> his conviction for three counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to distribute
> controlled substances over the Dark Web. The prison term will be followed by a three-year period
> of supervised release. Sam Bent's sentence also included a $14,000 forfeiture money judgment.
> Chief United States District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Sam Bent to surrender to the Bureau
> of Prisons on October 1, 2019

#### The video

Remember we're still talking about principles.
Some of the principles that we discussed in class are:

- The principle of _freedom_
- The principle of _autonomy_
- The principle of _justice_
- The principle of _knowledge_

Sam Bent participated in the Def Con 30 and gave a talk about the dark web and the job he did selling drugs.
After he was arrested, he started working as a security consultant. Watch the video of the conference and
then answer the questions.

- Does the fact that he has been working with the justice redeem the crimes he did?
- Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, did he violate any principle?
- If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?


### 3. Discussion

Make a team up to 4 people and think about other principles that you believe are relevant to this case.

- The principle of _accountability_
- The principle of _privacy_

With the principles in mind, discuss briefly if they collide and which.

Take notes of the discussion.

> Sam Bent stressed the principle of privacy to sell drugs on the dark web. He also took responsibility
> for his actions and worked with the department of justice, but, he used human beings as means and not as ends,
> violating the principle of freedom and autonomy. I think that there should be a hierarchy of principles
> so it would be easier to address the problems that arise when the principles are in some kind of collision.
> To solve this, I think that we shouldn't justify his actions, because if there was a hierarchy, probably
> the principle of freedom and autonomy should be more basic than the principle of privacy. Therefore, we cannot
